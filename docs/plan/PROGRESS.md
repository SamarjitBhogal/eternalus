# Progress log

## Purpose

Read the last three entries before you start any task: they tell you which phase and sprint is
active, which branch it lives on, what the last `npm run check` said and what the next step is.
Append an entry when you finish a session (humans and agents alike, per
[README.md §1](README.md#1-how-phases-sprints-and-tasks-work) and
[running-agents.md](../agents/running-agents.md)). The phase docs hold the checklists; this file
holds the history, the measured numbers and the decisions that changed the plan. Sprint metrics
are recorded here with the machine they were measured on, so the roadmap's metrics dashboard
can point at an entry instead of a memory.

## Format rules

- **Append-only, newest at the bottom.** Never rewrite, reorder or delete an earlier entry; to
  correct one, append a new entry that says what was wrong. The only allowed edit to an old
  entry is fixing a broken link.
- **One entry per work session or PR**, under a level-3 heading of exactly this shape:
  `### YYYY-MM-DD — <phase/sprint> — <branch> — <who or agent>`. `<phase/sprint>` is
  `Phase N / sprint N.M` (or `Phase N / sprints N.M–N.K`); `<branch>` is the git branch the
  work is on; `<who or agent>` is a GitHub handle for a human, or `<handle> + <tool>` for an
  agent session (for example `sholtzman + Claude Code`, `abc + Codex`).
- **Three bullets, always in this order:**
  - `What was done:` the tasks ticked (name them as in the phase doc), files or features
    touched, decisions made or asked for (INBOX ids), metrics measured with the machine
    (CPU, RAM, browser and version) when a sprint metric is involved.
  - `Checks run:` the verbatim command and its result line, for example `npm run check` →
    `All checks passed (format, lint, typecheck, knip, coverage, build, docs)` or
    `npm run test:soak` → `18,000 ticks, 0 violations, 41 s`. Quote failures verbatim too; a
    failing check is not hidden ([AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)).
  - `Next step:` the next task, PR or decision, with who owns it.
- Keep an entry under 15 lines; link to the PR, commit or INBOX item rather than repeating it.
- Meeting minutes (walkthroughs, retrospectives) are entries too: `<phase/sprint>` is the
  sprint that scheduled the meeting and the bullets list attendees, decisions and actions.
- Never log secrets, tokens or personal data; the file is committed.
- Agents append; they never commit or push the file unless asked (`AGENTS.md`).

## Example entry

The example below is fenced so it is not read as a real entry.

```markdown
### 2026-10-14 — Phase 1 / sprint 1.1 — feat/core-seeded-random — sholtzman + Claude Code

- What was done: `SeededRandom` (sfc32) and the deterministic math wrappers with known-answer
  tests; `StateHasher` (FNV-1a) with equal/changed-state tests; ESLint ban on `Math.sin/cos`
  outside `core/utils/`. Asked INBOX DEC-06 (world scale) to be answered before 1.3 starts.
- Checks run: `npm run check` → `All checks passed (format, lint, typecheck, knip, coverage, build, docs)`;
  coverage core 83% / client 55%.
- Next step: open the PR into `phase/1-simulation-kernel-and-world`; reviewer: the map owner.
  Then `Vec2` and geometry helpers (sprint 1.1, next checkbox).
```

## Entries

### 2026-09-30 — Phase 0 / sprints 0.1–0.4 — docs/phase-0-foundation — sholtzman + Claude Code

- What was done: the Phase 0 documentation foundation written on `docs/phase-0-foundation`:
  the `docs/` tree of the writer brief (plan with phases 0–6, backlog and this log;
  architecture 01–17; reference game-design 00–12, suggestions and the source transcription;
  requirements 01–06 and the source transcription; research reports and works cited; process,
  agents, decisions ADR 0003–0009, changelog), the root instruction files (`AGENTS.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`), the harness scaffold and `INBOX.md` with decisions DEC-01–DEC-10.
  See [phase-0-documentation-and-harness.md](phase-0-documentation-and-harness.md) and the
  changelog entry [2026-09-30-phase-0-foundation.md](../changelog/2026-09-30-phase-0-foundation.md).
- Checks run (authoring sandbox, Node 22 with `engine-strict=false`; CI repeats on Node 24 ×
  3 OSes): `npm run format:check` → "All matched files use Prettier code style!";
  `npm run lint` → clean (zero warnings); `npm run typecheck` → clean; `npm run knip` → clean
  (run with `KNIP_DISABLE_RAW_TRANSFER=1` because the sandbox could not allocate oxc's raw
  buffer — environment limit, not a finding); `npm run test:coverage` → core 1/1, client 1/1
  passed, thresholds met; `npm run build` → built; `npm run docs:check` → "Checked 86 Markdown
  files under docs/. Documentation check passed." Hook scripts exercised by hand per
  `docs/agents/tool-setup.md` §6 (post-edit exit 0, stop-check exit 0, session-start exit 0).
- Next step: push `docs/phase-0-foundation`, open the PR to `main` with reviewer
  SamarjitBhogal, hold the team walkthrough (sprint 0.5, week 1) and answer the INBOX decisions
  DEC-01–DEC-10; owner: sholtzman.

### 2026-10-02 — Phase 1 / sprint 1.2 — copilot/implement-entity-modules — claudiodh + Copilot Coding Agent

- What was done: added foundational `packages/core/src/entities/*.js` modules (`Entity`, `Unit`, `Legend`, `Mob`, `EntityRegistry`, `EntityFactory`) plus focused `.test.js` coverage for abstract construction, family contracts, lifecycle order, component helpers, registry/factory behavior and unknown kind/cause errors; updated `packages/core/vitest.config.ts` so core discovers `.test.js` and includes `.js` sources in coverage; kept `packages/core/src/index.ts` unchanged (no public API export yet).
- Checks run: `npm run test -w @eternalus/core` → `Test Files 5 passed (5), Tests 13 passed (13)`; `npm run check:quick` → passed (`typecheck` + `lint`); `npm run check` → passed (`format:check`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `knip`, `test:coverage`, `build`, `docs:check`).
- Next step: wire concrete entity kinds and content definitions into the registry as Sprint 1.2 entity implementation continues; owner: sim lane.

### 2026-10-03 — Phase 0 follow-up / INBOX batch 1 — docs/inbox-decisions-2026-10-03 — sholtzman + Claude (Cowork)

- What was done: recorded the owner's INBOX answers (DEC-01…DEC-10, 32 discrepancies) in
  `docs/reference/game-design/13-owner-decisions-log.md`; re-cut the plan to four two-week
  sprints ending at the 2026-11-27 presentation (`docs/plan/README.md` §0); extended
  `SessionPhase` with the character-select / pre-launch / match-loading flow; renamed Assault →
  Warrior across the docs; wrote the Sprint 1 session prompts
  (`docs/agents/prompts/2026-10-03-ultracode-sessions.md`); opened DEC-11…DEC-13 in `INBOX.md`.
- Checks run: `npm run format:check`, `npm run docs:check` (see the commit for the verbatim
  lines); CI repeats `npm run check` on the PR.
- Next step: push the branch, PR into `main`; create `phase/1-simulation-kernel-and-world`;
  start sessions B and D (then A, F, E, G; C after B; H in week 2) per the prompts file; close
  `copilot/implement-entity-modules` with the review-R text; answer DEC-11…DEC-13.

### 2026-10-05 — Phase 1 / sprint 1.2 — refactor/implement-entity-modules — SamarjitBhogal + Claude Code

- What was done: ported `packages/core/src/entities/*.js` one-to-one to TypeScript (`Entity`, `Unit`, `Legend`, `Mob`, `EntityRegistry`, `EntityFactory`, plus `Entity.types.ts` and `EntityRegistry.types.ts`) with `.test.ts` ports of every JS test and a few added cases; deleted the JS files; reverted `packages/core/vitest.config.ts` to `.ts`-only globs. Added `npm run check:no-js` (`scripts/checks/no-js.mjs`): fails on any tracked/staged `.js`/`.jsx`/`.mjs`/`.cjs` except `eslint.config.js` and `scripts/**/*.mjs`; it runs in `check:quick` (git hooks), `check` and CI. Documented in `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/process/guardrails.md`.
- Checks run: `npm run check` → exit 0 (format, no-js, lint, typecheck, knip, core tests 20/20 at 100% coverage, client 27/27, build, docs 87 files passed). Guard self-tested: staging `packages/core/src/x.js` makes `check:no-js` exit 1.
- Next step: wire concrete entity kinds and content definitions into the registry; owner: sim lane.

### 2026-10-05 — Phase 1 / sprint 1.2 — refactor/implement-entity-modules — SamarjitBhogal + Claude Code

- What was done: addressed the PR #4 review on entity ids. `EntityFactory.create(kind, definitionId, spawnContext)` no longer takes an id; the factory assigns `entity-<n>` from a per-factory counter (`EntityFactory.constants.ts`), so ids are unique per match and deterministic for replays (no `Math.random`). Added a test for sequential, per-factory ids.
- Checks run: `npm run check` → exit 0 (core 21/21 tests, 100% coverage).
- Next step: wire concrete entity kinds and content definitions into the registry; owner: sim lane.

### 2026-10-06 — Process / pre-PR gate — chore/pre-pr-gate — sholtzman + Claude Code

- What was done: owner decision to add a pre-PR gate after the Definition of done (independent
  architecture critic, ponytail pass, `npm run check` re-run, then the PR) — ADR 0010, `AGENTS.md`
  "Before opening a PR" and "Ponytail", CONTRIBUTING §8, checklists §1/§4, PR template, git
  workflow, guardrails table, harness doc, `verify`/`pr-review` skills. Ponytail runs at `lite`,
  injected into the main session and coding subagents only (`.claude/settings.json` env; matcher
  pipe-tested). Documentation longevity rule OG-12 and ADR 0011 after a doc sweep corroded
  architecture docs. Every changed doc was reviewed independently against OG-12.
- Checks run: `npm run check` → exit 0: "All matched files use Prettier code style!"; lint,
  typecheck and knip clean; core "Tests 7 passed (7)", client "Tests 27 passed (27)"; "✓ built"; "Documentation check passed."
- Next step: the human pushes `chore/pre-pr-gate` and opens it into `main` after PR #5; in the
  first new session, confirm ponytail starts at `lite` (per-project mode flag).

### 2026-10-06 — Phase 1 / sprint 1 setup — phase/1-simulation-kernel-and-world — sholtzman + Claude Code

- What was done: brought the phase branch up to date for the Sprint 1 sessions by merging
  `origin/main` (`4cff2a7`), `origin/docs/inbox-decisions-2026-10-03` (`3fab2df`) and
  `origin/chore/pre-pr-gate` (`bdf2e37`). Conflicts: this log (every entry kept, oldest first) and
  `docs/process/guardrails.md` (`last-reviewed` → 2026-10-06; all 22 table rows kept). The agent's
  own `git fetch` failed on keychain auth; merged refs from the human's 18:15 fetch.
- Checks run: `npm ci` → ok; `npm run docs:index` → "Documentation check passed." (no changes);
  `npm run check` → exit 0: Prettier clean, lint/typecheck/knip clean, core "Tests 37 passed
  (37)" at 100%, client "Tests 27 passed (27)", "✓ built", "Documentation check passed."
- Next step: the human pushes the phase branch; start the Sprint 1 sessions per
  `docs/agents/prompts/2026-10-03-ultracode-sessions.md`.
