# Progress log

## Purpose

Read the last three entries before you start any task: they tell you which phase and sprint is
active, which branch it lives on, what the last `npm run check` said and what the next step is.
Append an entry when you finish a session (humans and agents alike, per
[README.md §1](README.md#1-how-phases-sprints-and-tasks-work) and
[running-agents.md](../agents/running-agents.md)). The phase docs hold the checklists; this file
holds the history, the measured numbers and the decisions that changed the plan. Sprint metrics
are recorded here with the machine they were measured on, so the roadmap's metrics dashboard
can point at an entry instead of a memory.

## Format rules

- **Append-only, newest at the bottom.** Never rewrite, reorder or delete an earlier entry; to
  correct one, append a new entry that says what was wrong. The only allowed edit to an old
  entry is fixing a broken link.
- **One entry per work session or PR**, under a level-3 heading of exactly this shape:
  `### YYYY-MM-DD — <phase/sprint> — <branch> — <who or agent>`. `<phase/sprint>` is
  `Phase N / sprint N.M` (or `Phase N / sprints N.M–N.K`); `<branch>` is the git branch the
  work is on; `<who or agent>` is a GitHub handle for a human, or `<handle> + <tool>` for an
  agent session (for example `sholtzman + Claude Code`, `abc + Codex`).
- **Three bullets, always in this order:**
  - `What was done:` the tasks ticked (name them as in the phase doc), files or features
    touched, decisions made or asked for (INBOX ids), metrics measured with the machine
    (CPU, RAM, browser and version) when a sprint metric is involved.
  - `Checks run:` the verbatim command and its result line, for example `npm run check` →
    `All checks passed (format, lint, typecheck, knip, coverage, build, docs)` or
    `npm run test:soak` → `18,000 ticks, 0 violations, 41 s`. Quote failures verbatim too; a
    failing check is not hidden ([AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)).
  - `Next step:` the next task, PR or decision, with who owns it.
- Keep an entry under 15 lines; link to the PR, commit or INBOX item rather than repeating it.
- Meeting minutes (walkthroughs, retrospectives) are entries too: `<phase/sprint>` is the
  sprint that scheduled the meeting and the bullets list attendees, decisions and actions.
- Never log secrets, tokens or personal data; the file is committed.
- Agents append; they never commit or push the file unless asked (`AGENTS.md`).

## Example entry

The example below is fenced so it is not read as a real entry.

```markdown
### 2026-10-14 — Phase 1 / sprint 1.1 — feat/core-seeded-random — sholtzman + Claude Code

- What was done: `SeededRandom` (sfc32) and the deterministic math wrappers with known-answer
  tests; `StateHasher` (FNV-1a) with equal/changed-state tests; ESLint ban on `Math.sin/cos`
  outside `core/utils/`. Asked INBOX DEC-06 (world scale) to be answered before 1.3 starts.
- Checks run: `npm run check` → `All checks passed (format, lint, typecheck, knip, coverage, build, docs)`;
  coverage core 83% / client 55%.
- Next step: open the PR into `phase/1-simulation-kernel-and-world`; reviewer: the map owner.
  Then `Vec2` and geometry helpers (sprint 1.1, next checkbox).
```

## Entries

### 2026-09-30 — Phase 0 / sprints 0.1–0.4 — docs/phase-0-foundation — sholtzman + Claude Code

- What was done: the Phase 0 documentation foundation written on `docs/phase-0-foundation`:
  the `docs/` tree of the writer brief (plan with phases 0–6, backlog and this log;
  architecture 01–17; reference game-design 00–12, suggestions and the source transcription;
  requirements 01–06 and the source transcription; research reports and works cited; process,
  agents, decisions ADR 0003–0009, changelog), the root instruction files (`AGENTS.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`), the harness scaffold and `INBOX.md` with decisions DEC-01–DEC-10.
  See [phase-0-documentation-and-harness.md](phase-0-documentation-and-harness.md) and the
  changelog entry [2026-09-30-phase-0-foundation.md](../changelog/2026-09-30-phase-0-foundation.md).
- Checks run (authoring sandbox, Node 22 with `engine-strict=false`; CI repeats on Node 24 ×
  3 OSes): `npm run format:check` → "All matched files use Prettier code style!";
  `npm run lint` → clean (zero warnings); `npm run typecheck` → clean; `npm run knip` → clean
  (run with `KNIP_DISABLE_RAW_TRANSFER=1` because the sandbox could not allocate oxc's raw
  buffer — environment limit, not a finding); `npm run test:coverage` → core 1/1, client 1/1
  passed, thresholds met; `npm run build` → built; `npm run docs:check` → "Checked 86 Markdown
  files under docs/. Documentation check passed." Hook scripts exercised by hand per
  `docs/agents/tool-setup.md` §6 (post-edit exit 0, stop-check exit 0, session-start exit 0).
- Next step: push `docs/phase-0-foundation`, open the PR to `main` with reviewer
  SamarjitBhogal, hold the team walkthrough (sprint 0.5, week 1) and answer the INBOX decisions
  DEC-01–DEC-10; owner: sholtzman.

### 2026-10-03 — Phase 0 follow-up / INBOX batch 1 — docs/inbox-decisions-2026-10-03 — sholtzman + Claude (Cowork)

- What was done: recorded the owner's INBOX answers (DEC-01…DEC-10, 32 discrepancies) in
  `docs/reference/game-design/13-owner-decisions-log.md`; re-cut the plan to four two-week
  sprints ending at the 2026-11-27 presentation (`docs/plan/README.md` §0); extended
  `SessionPhase` with the character-select / pre-launch / match-loading flow; renamed Assault →
  Warrior across the docs; wrote the Sprint 1 session prompts
  (`docs/agents/prompts/2026-10-03-ultracode-sessions.md`); opened DEC-11…DEC-13 in `INBOX.md`.
- Checks run: `npm run format:check`, `npm run docs:check` (see the commit for the verbatim
  lines); CI repeats `npm run check` on the PR.
- Next step: push the branch, PR into `main`; create `phase/1-simulation-kernel-and-world`;
  start sessions B and D (then A, F, E, G; C after B; H in week 2) per the prompts file; close
  `copilot/implement-entity-modules` with the review-R text; answer DEC-11…DEC-13.

### 2026-10-05 — Phase 1 / sprint 1.3 (session A) — feat/map-generator — sholtzman + Claude Code

- What was done: audited the merged `feat/map`/`feat/map-view` code
  (`docs/reviews/2026-10-05-map-code-audit.md`). Replaced the hand-traced `MAP_1` with a pure,
  deterministic `MapGenerator` + `MapBuilder` (strongholds, lanes, towers on `t` bands, wall
  ring with a gate per lane and turrets, camps by depth per DISC-42, capture points with the
  Cathedral on the middle lane, a symmetric rift with a bridge gap per lane, seeded obstacles),
  the `teams/` module, the `map-1` preset (fractions of the world, lane profile, rift width
  profile) and the `WorldMap` walkability grid. Client: `Renderer` port + `Canvas2dRenderer`,
  `RecordingRenderer`, glyph-based map and minimap drawing. An independent reviewer agent
  checked the branch against the base-commit architecture. Its findings F1–F18 (sealed gates at
  7+ lanes, leaky walls, an asymmetric default map and others) were fixed and recorded in audit
  §6. Architecture 02 and 06 (§10), the core and client `AGENTS.md`, sprint 1.3 checkboxes,
  INBOX (DEC-14–DEC-16, requests to session B) and the PR description
  (`docs/changelog/pr-feat-map-generator.md`) were updated.
- Checks run (worktree `.worktrees/map-generator`, Node 24.21.0): `npm run check` → exit 0.
  "All matched files use Prettier code style!"; lint clean; typecheck clean; knip clean apart
  from the existing configuration hint "@eternalus/core apps/client knip.json Remove from
  ignoreDependencies"; core "Test Files 8 passed (8) / Tests 91 passed (91)", coverage
  statements 97.92 %, branches 86.26 %; client "Test Files 7 passed (7) / Tests 36 passed (36)",
  statements 80.78 %, branches 74.35 %; "✓ built"; "Checked 93 Markdown files under docs/.
  Documentation check passed."
- Next step: push `phase/1-simulation-kernel-and-world` (from `main`) and `feat/map-generator`,
  open the PR into the phase branch with reviewer Aryan Walanj. The owner answers DEC-14–DEC-16.
  Once session B lands `config/`, swap the local `MapConfig`/`DEFAULT_MAP_CONFIG` for
  `GameConfig` (owner: sholtzman).

### 2026-10-05 — Phase 1 / sprint 1.3 (session A, re-review) — feat/map-generator — sholtzman + Claude Code

- What was done: the reviewer's second pass found that at aspect ratios other than 16:9, lanes
  could run back through their own wall ring (N1). Lanes now leave each gate straight through
  a 20-unit apron and only bend eastwards. The validator rejects lanes that run west or through
  walls, turrets or Strongholds. Seeds are limited to 0…2³²−1 and lane profiles are validated.
  Corrected overstated wording (world size, the B1 argument, which DEC-14 items were judged
  better) in the audit §6, INBOX DEC-14/15, arch 06 §10 and the PR description. The golden map
  hash changed on purpose (lane apron).
- Checks run: `npm run check` → exit 0. "All matched files use Prettier code style!"; lint,
  typecheck clean; knip clean apart from the existing configuration hint; core "Test Files 8
  passed (8) / Tests 96 passed (96)", statements 97.84 %, branches 87.03 %; client "Test Files
  7 passed (7) / Tests 36 passed (36)", statements 80.78 %, branches 74.35 %; "✓ built";
  "Checked 93 Markdown files under docs/. Documentation check passed."
- Next step: unchanged from the entry above (push both branches, open the PR with reviewer
  Aryan Walanj; the owner answers DEC-14–DEC-16).
- Follow-up (same day): the reviewer's targeted N1 check confirmed the fix (all probed worlds
  generate, lanes never touch a wall, turret or Stronghold, every lane connects). Its two nits
  were fixed: `wallRing.laneApron` is now validated (the rule had not been applied; the new test
  fails without it), and a test title no longer claims "any world size". `npm run check` → exit
  0; core "Tests 97 passed (97)", client "Tests 36 passed (36)"; "Documentation check passed."

### 2026-10-06 — Phase 1 / sprint 1.3 (session A, docs) — feat/map-generator — sholtzman + Claude Code

- What was done: the owner signed off DEC-14 (the four map-generator refinements the critic
  judged better than architecture 06); recorded in the decisions log and INBOX. A first
  automated doc sweep corroded the docs (target designs replaced by interim code, tuning values
  copied into architecture 06) and was reverted before commit. Redone surgically: architecture 06
  §2–§6 now carry DEC-14 as design text and §10 lists only interim items; 32 other living docs got
  minimal corrections (contract type names, superseded design, stale "no code yet" claims), each
  checked by an independent reviewer against OG-12 (`chore/pre-pr-gate`). No record was edited.
- Checks run: `npm run check` → exit 0: "All matched files use Prettier code style!"; lint,
  typecheck and knip clean; core "Tests 97 passed (97)", client "Tests 36 passed (36)"; "✓ built"; "Documentation check passed."
- Next step: the human pushes `feat/map-generator`; run the new pre-PR gate's ponytail step on
  PR #8; merge `main` (now with PR #9) into the phase branch and resolve any conflict.
